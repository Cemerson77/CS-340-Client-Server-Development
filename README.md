## Question 1: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In the context of this project, I focused on creating programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The foundational principle was the integration of the CRUD Python module developed in Project One into the dashboard code for Project Two. This approach offered several advantages in terms of code organization and clarity. By encapsulating database interactions within the CRUD module, I ensured the separation of concerns, contributing to maintainability and readability. This modular design facilitated adaptability as changes to the database structure or queries could be made within the module without directly affecting the dashboard code. Overall, this strategy enhanced the overall quality of the codebase.

## Question 2: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

My approach to problem-solving in this project was characteristic of a computer scientist's mindset. In addressing the requirements set by Grazioso Salvare, I adopted a systematic approach. I thoroughly analyzed the company's needs, translated them into actionable database queries, and designed corresponding dashboard components. This approach differed from previous assignments in other courses where I focused primarily on individual coding tasks. In this project, I needed to integrate various components to create a functional dashboard that fulfilled the specific needs of the client. This holistic problem-solving approach allowed me to develop a comprehensive solution that aligned with the client's expectations.

## Question 3: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists play a pivotal role in developing effective solutions to real-world problems. In the context of this project, my work holds significance for companies like Grazioso Salvare. By creating a user-friendly dashboard for managing animal data, I contribute to improving their operations. The modular design, made possible by the CRUD module, ensures the company's ability to adapt and scale its data management processes. Through data visualization and interactive filtering, the dashboard empowers Grazioso Salvare to make informed decisions, track animal outcomes, and optimize their services. This project exemplifies how computer scientists address complex challenges, enhance organizational efficiency, and drive meaningful impacts.
